### **1. Data Encryption Requirements**

1. **Data in Transit**:
    
    - Use **TLS 1.3** for all data transmitted between clients (mobile/web apps) and backend servers to prevent interception of sensitive data.
    - Enforce end-to-end encryption for teleconsultations, ensuring that video/audio streams are protected during transmission.
2. **Data at Rest**:
    
    - Use **AES-256 encryption** for all sensitive data stored in databases, such as patient records, consultation logs, and X-ray images.
    - Apply encryption to backups, ensuring that all copies of data retain encryption when stored off-site or on physical nodes.

### **2. Access Control and Authentication Requirements**

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO) with OAuth2.0**:
    
    - Implement **SSO** for secure, consistent access across mobile and web platforms, providing a seamless yet secure user experience for patients, doctors, and paramedics.
    - Use **OAuth2.0** to handle authorization, generating secure tokens for each session to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
    - eg. SSO with Google, Microsoft, facebook account or Email
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    
    - Define specific roles (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Paramedic, Super Admin and admin) with permissions tailored to each userâ€™s needs and responsibilities.
    - Ensure that only authorized roles can access sensitive data, such as patient records, X-ray results, or teleconsultation logs.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    
    - Require MFA for all **high-privilege users** (e.g., doctors, administrators) to provide additional security for accounts with access to sensitive information.
    - Implement app-based or SMS-based MFA for enhanced security.

### **3. Compliance with Healthcare Data Regulations**

1. **HIPAA ,DISHA Compliance**:
    
    - Design all data handling processes to comply with **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) , DISHA (Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act)regulations, ensuring patient data privacy and security.
    - Regularly audit and review the platform's compliance to ensure ongoing adherence to HIPAA, DISHA standards.
2. **Data Retention Policy**:
    
    - Store patient records, including consultation logs and X-ray images, for a minimum of **7 years** as required by healthcare regulations.
    - Define clear protocols for secure deletion or archiving of data after the retention period to maintain compliance.
3. **Geolocation-Specific Data Storage**:
    
    - Store patient data in **localized data centers** based on regional laws and regulations, ensuring that data sovereignty requirements are met.

### **4. Audit and Logging Requirements**

1. **Audit Logging**:
    
    - Enable comprehensive logging for all user activities, including logins, data access, and modifications, to ensure an audit trail is available for security investigations.
    - Store logs securely for a minimum of **1 year** to facilitate future audits and regulatory checks.
2. **User Access Audits**:
    
    - Conduct **periodic audits** of user access and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.
    - Use automated tools to flag unauthorized access attempts or unusual patterns for review.
3. **Log Integrity**:
    
    - Implement **immutable logging** to prevent tampering of log data, ensuring that audit trails are preserved accurately for compliance and forensic purposes.

### **5. Data Privacy and Anonymization**

1. **Data Masking for Testing**:
    
    - Use **data masking** or anonymization techniques in non-production environments (e.g., testing, development) to prevent exposure of sensitive patient information.
2. **User Consent Management**:
    
    - Provide a user consent mechanism for storing, processing, and sharing their data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
    - Allow patients to access, modify, or request deletion of their data in accordance with data privacy laws like **GDPR** (if applicable).

---

### **6. Incident Detection and Response Requirements**

1. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**:
    
    - Use **intrusion detection** (IDS) and **intrusion prevention systems** (IPS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities or known threat patterns.
    - Implement **DDoS protection** to safeguard the platform from denial-of-service attacks, especially for teleconsultation services.
2. **Automated Alerts**:
    
    - Configure automated alerts for unauthorized data access, multiple failed login attempts, and other suspicious activity, notifying the security team for immediate response.
3. **Data Breach Response Plan**:
    
    - Establish a **data breach response plan** with procedures for isolating and addressing security incidents, notifying affected users, and reporting to regulatory bodies if required.
    - Conduct **regular incident response drills** to ensure the team is prepared to handle data breaches effectively.

---

### **7. Backup and Recovery Security Requirements**

1. **Backup Encryption**:
    
    - Encrypt all backup data both at rest and in transit, ensuring that copies of patient data retain the same security as the primary database.
2. **Backup Access Control**:
    
    - Limit access to backups to authorized personnel only, using role-based access to manage permissions.
3. **Regular Security Testing**:
    
    - Perform regular **vulnerability assessments** and **penetration testing** on the backup and recovery systems to identify and address potential security gaps.

---

### **8. Monitoring and Compliance Reporting**

1. **Compliance Reporting**:
    - Implement automated reporting tools to provide compliance reports on HIPAA, DISHA and other regulatory standards, available on-demand for audits.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
    - Use a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system to monitor security events across the platform in real time, providing quick insights into potential threats.
