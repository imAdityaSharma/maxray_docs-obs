### **Functional Requirements for Super Admins**

1. **Platform Configuration**:
    - **Global Settings**: Super Admins can configure platform-wide settings, including encryption protocols, data retention rules, and teleconsultation settings.
    - **Manage System Updates**: Super Admins initiate and approve system software updates and patches to keep the platform up to date.
    - **User Role Customization**: Super Admins can customize or create new user roles with specific access privileges.
    
1. **Advanced Security and Compliance Management**:
    - **Access Control Policies**: Super Admins can define and modify access control policies, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible by authorized users.
    - **Audit Logs Modification**: Super Admins have access to higher-level audit logs that include admin activities and access changes across the platform.
    - **Compliance Review and Certification**: Super Admins oversee compliance reviews and maintain documentation necessary for certifications, including HIPAA and other regional regulations.
    
1. **System Resource Allocation**:
    - **Scalability Management**: Super Admins can allocate system resources for scalability, enabling auto-scaling policies and load balancing as necessary.
    - **Database and Storage Management**: Super Admins manage storage capacity and data partitioning to optimize performance and efficiency.
    
1. **Disaster Recovery and Incident Management**:
    - **Disaster Recovery Protocols**: Super Admins set up and maintain disaster recovery plans, including recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
    - **Incident Response Coordination**: Super Admins coordinate incident responses, particularly in cases of data breaches, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to minimize impact.

### **Non-Functional Requirements for Admins and Super Admins**

1. **Usability**:
    - **Intuitive Admin Dashboard**: The admin dashboard should be user-friendly and provide quick access to monitoring tools, user management, and system reports.
    - **Real-Time Refresh Rate**: Data displayed in the dashboard (e.g., user activities, system health) should refresh in real-time or near real-time (within 1 second).

1. **Performance**:
    - **Low Latency for Admin Actions**: Admin actions (e.g., accessing user data, performing backups) should complete within 1 second to ensure smooth management.
    - **System Availability**: Ensure system uptime of 99.9% to avoid disruptions in system monitoring and user management capabilities.
    - **Data Backup Speed**: Data backups should complete efficiently, even during peak hours, without impacting system performance.
    
1. **Security**:
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all admin and super admin accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforce strict RBAC to limit super admin privileges, ensuring only designated users can make critical changes.
    - **Session Timeout**: Automatically log out inactive admin sessions after a specified time to prevent unauthorized access in shared environments.
    
1. **Compliance**:
    - **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure that all admin activities involving patient data meet HIPAA standards for security and privacy.
    - **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed, immutable audit logs of admin activities for at least 1 year to support compliance with regulatory requirements.
    - **Data Encryption**: Use end-to-end encryption for any sensitive data accessed or modified by admins, maintaining both data privacy and security.
    
1. **Reliability**:
    - **Redundancy in Monitoring Systems**: Ensure that monitoring systems have redundancy to prevent loss of data in case of failure.
    - **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options for all admin tasks, especially for critical functions like data backup, user management, and incident resolution.
