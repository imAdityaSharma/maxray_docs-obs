### **Teleconference Service: Design, Responsibilities, and Implementation**

The **Teleconference Service** facilitates real-time video and audio communication between patients, doctors, and paramedics during consultations or emergencies. It integrates with other services like Patient Service and Doctor Service to manage participant details and session statuses.

---
### **1. Primary Requirements**

1. **Session Management**:
    - Initiate, join, and terminate video/audio teleconsultation sessions.
    -  Track active and completed sessions
2. **Participant Management**:
	 - Add or remove participants dynamically (patients, doctors, paramedics).
	 - Manage participants (patients, doctors, paramedics) dynamically within a session.
3. **End-to-End Encryption**:
    - Encrypt all video, audio, and chat data to ensure communication security.
4. **Session Logging**:
    - Log metadata (e.g., session start/end times, participants) without storing actual content.
5. **Real-Time Communication**:
    - Provide low-latency, secure video and audio communication.
    - Support chat and file sharing for sending diagnostic data or prescriptions.
6. **Integration with Other Services**:
    - Collaborate with Patient Service and Doctor Service for session scheduling and status updates.
    - Notify participants using the Notification Service.
7. **Session Recording and Playback**:
    - Enable optional session recording for compliance or reference.
    - Provide playback links for authorized participants.
8. **Screen Sharing and File Sharing**:
    - Allow participants to share their screens or upload files like X-rays or prescriptions.
9. **Quality Control**:
    - Monitor network conditions to optimize video and audio quality dynamically.

### **2. Secondary Requirements**

1. **Session Recording**:
    - Provide optional recording of sessions, ensuring consent from all participants.
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Handle connectivity issues with automatic reconnection and degraded quality modes.
3. **Notifications**:
    - Notify participants about session start, invites, and disconnections in real time.
4. **Role-Based Permissions**:
    - Enforce permissions (e.g., only doctors can share prescriptions, paramedics can join in emergencies).
5. **Multi-Device Support**:
    - Allow participants to join sessions from mobile, web, or desktop devices.
6. **Analytics and Reporting**:
    - Provide analytics on session performance, participant engagement, and connection issues.

### **Technology Stack**
#### **Core Communication Tools**:
1. **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer video/audio streaming.
2. **Signaling Server**: To facilitate WebRTC connections using protocols like WebSocket.
3. **TURN/STUN Servers**:
    - Use **Coturn** as a TURN server for NAT traversal.
4. **Media Server**:
    - **Jitsi** or **Janus**: For group calls, recording, and media routing.
#### **Backend**:
- **Programming Language**: Node.js or Python for REST and signaling server.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for session metadata.
- **Caching**: Redis for active session tracking.
#### **Frontend SDKs**:
- **WebRTC API**: For browser-based video calls.
- **Flutter WebRTC Plugin**: For mobile applications.

### **6. Functional Safety Considerations**
1. **Data Security**:
    - Use end-to-end encryption for all communication and file transfers.
    - Testing: Verify encryption keys are generated per session and not reused.
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
    - Implement automatic reconnection for participants in case of network issues.
    - Testing: Simulate unstable connections to verify fallback performance.
3. **Consent Management**:
    - Ensure explicit consent is obtained before recording sessions.
    - Testing: Validate consent workflows and ensure non-consenting users are excluded.
4. **Audit Logging**:
    - Log session metadata (e.g., participants, duration) without recording sensitive content.
    - Testing: Ensure logs are complete, accurate, and immutable.
