### **Patient Service: Design, Responsibilities, and Implementation**

The **Patient Service** is a microservice dedicated to managing patient-related functionalities, including profile management, medical history, teleconsultation requests, and emergency alerts. It interacts with other microservices like Doctor Service, Paramedic Service, and X-ray Service to provide a seamless experience for patients.

### **Responsibilities**

1. **Patient Profile Management**:
    - Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) patient profiles.
    - Manage patient-specific details like UPI ID, insurance, and contact information.
2. **Medical History**:
    - Store and retrieve patient medical history, including past consultations and test results.
    - Link medical records with X-ray images and prescriptions.
3. **Teleconsultation Requests**:
    - Allow patients to request teleconsultations with available doctors.
    - Track the status of consultations (e.g., Scheduled, Ongoing, Completed).
4. **Emergency Alerts**:
    - Process patient-generated emergency requests.
    - Notify the Paramedic Service for task assignments and tracking.
5. **Interaction with Other Services**:
    - Integrate with Doctor Service to fetch available doctors.
    - Communicate with Notification Service for appointment reminders.
    - Collaborate with X-ray Service for medical image access.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Python (FastAPI or Flask for REST APIs).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured patient data.
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data (e.g., consultation statuses).
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication (e.g., sending consultation requests to Doctor Service).
