The Notification Service is responsible for delivering real-time alerts and updates to users (patients, doctors, paramedics, and admins) via multiple channels like email, SMS, and push notifications.
### 1. Primary Requirements 
1. **Real-Time Notifications:**
	- Deliver instant notifications for critical events like emergency updates, appointment reminders, or system alerts. 
2. **Multi-Channel Support:** 
	- Send notifications through email, SMS, and push notifications.
3. **User Preferences:**
	 - Allow users to manage notification preferences for different types of alerts. 
5. **Scheduled Notifications:**
	- Schedule non-critical notifications, such as follow-up reminders. 
6. **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retries for undelivered notifications.
### Secondary Requirements Localization:
1. **Support notifications in multiple languages**. 
2. **Analytics:** Provide insights into notification delivery metrics (e.g., success rates, open rates). 
3. **Priority Handling**: Classify notifications by priority (e.g., critical, non-critical) and deliver accordingly. 
4. **Integration with Services:** Integrate seamlessly with services like Emergency Request, Patient, and Doctor Services.

### **Notification Service Traceability**

| **Req ID** | **Description**                                   | **Traceability**       | **Test ID** | **Verification & Validation**                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| RQ-NS001   | Deliver real-time notifications for emergencies.  | Linked to SYS.3, SWE.2 | TST-NS001   | Validate delivery time under high-load scenarios. |
| RQ-NS002   | Support multi-channel notifications (email, SMS). | Linked to SYS.3, SWE.4 | TST-NS002   | Verify notifications across all channels.         |
| RQ-NS003   | Allow users to manage notification preferences.   | Linked to SYS.5, SWE.2 | TST-NS003   | Test enabling/disabling notifications by type.    |
| RQ-NS004   | Retry failed notifications automatically.         | Linked to SYS.3, SWE.4 | TST-NS004   | Simulate failures and validate retry mechanism.   |
| RQ-NS005   | Log notification delivery and failures.           | Linked to SYS.3, SWE.2 | TST-NS005   | Ensure logs are complete and accessible.          |
| RQ-NS006   | Provide priority handling for critical alerts.    | Linked to SYS.3, SWE.2 | TST-NS006   | Validate prioritization logic for notifications.  |
#### **Feature Testing**
**Test Cases**:

| **Test ID** | **Description**                          | **Expected Result**                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| TST-NS001   | Send emergency notification to a doctor. | Notification is delivered instantly.  |
| TST-NS002   | Retry undelivered notification.          | Notification is sent successfully.    |
| TST-NS003   | User disables appointment notifications. | Appointment reminders are suppressed. |

#### **Functional Safety Considerations**
1. **Critical Alerts**:
    - Ensure emergency notifications are prioritized over non-critical alerts.
    - Testing: Simulate high-load scenarios to validate prioritization.
2. **Delivery Failure Logs**:
    - Log all undelivered notifications for auditing and retries.
    - Testing: Verify logs capture all necessary information.
