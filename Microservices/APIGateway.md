### **API Gateway Micro service:**
Design, Responsibilities, and Implementation

The **API Gateway** acts as the central entry point for all client requests (mobile apps, web apps, or other systems) and routes them to the appropriate backend microservices. It simplifies communication, provides centralized security, and ensures scalability by decoupling frontend and backend services.

---

### **1. Primary Requirements**

1. **Request Routing**:
    - Route client requests to the appropriate microservices (e.g., Patient Service, Doctor Service).
    - Handles dynamic service discovery in case of auto-scaling or service updates.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Validates JWT tokens issued by the **Authentication Service**.
    - Ensures role-based access control (RBAC) by forwarding user roles and permissions to target services.
3. **Request Transformation**:
    - Modifies request payloads, headers, or query parameters as required by the downstream services.
4. **Request Validation**:
    - Validate incoming requests for required parameters, headers, and payloads.
5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
    - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs
    - Throttles requests during peak loads to maintain service stability.
6. **Load Balancing**:
    - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a microservice for better scalability and fault tolerance.
7. **Error Handling**:
	- Provide meaningful error messages for failed or invalid requests.
1. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Log all incoming and outgoing requests, responses, and errors for traceability.

---

### **2. Secondary Requirements**

1. **Load Balancing**:
    - Distribute traffic among multiple instances of backend services.
2. **API Versioning**:
    - Support multiple API versions to ensure backward compatibility.
3. **Retry and Circuit Breaker Mechanisms**:
    - Retry failed requests and handle service outages gracefully.
4. **Security Enforcement**:
    - Block malicious traffic using firewalls, IP whitelisting, and rate limits.
5. **Response Caching**:
    - Cache frequent responses to reduce backend load and improve response times.
6. **Dynamic Configuration**:
    - Allow runtime updates to routing rules, rate limits, and policies without downtime.
7. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
    - Collects metrics on API usage, response times, and errors.
    - Logs requests and responses for debugging and analytics purposes.

### **6. Functional Safety Considerations**
1. **Authentication Failures**:
    - Block unauthorized access to critical services and endpoints.
    - Testing: Simulate various authentication scenarios, including token expiration and invalid credentials.
2. **Traffic Load Management**:
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks and ensure system stability.
    - Testing: Simulate high traffic loads and validate throttling.
3. **Fallback for Service Outages**:
    - Redirect traffic to backup services or display meaningful error messages during outages.
    - Testing: Simulate backend service failures and validate fallback mechanisms.
4. **Secure Communication**:    
    - Use TLS 1.3 for all communication between clients and backend services.
    - Testing: Verify that all traffic is encrypted and connections are secure.
5. **Audit Logging**:
    - Log all transactions and errors for traceability and forensic analysis.
    - Testing: Validate that logs are complete, accurate, and immutable.
