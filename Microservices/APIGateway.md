### **API Gateway Micro service:**
Design, Responsibilities, and Implementation

The **API Gateway** acts as the central entry point for all client requests (mobile apps, web apps, or other systems) and routes them to the appropriate backend microservices. It simplifies communication, provides centralized security, and ensures scalability by decoupling frontend and backend services.

---

### **Responsibilities**

1. **Routing**:
    - Routes incoming client requests to the appropriate microservices based on the request path or headers.
    - Handles dynamic service discovery in case of auto-scaling or service updates.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Validates JWT tokens issued by the **Authentication Service**.
    - Ensures role-based access control (RBAC) by forwarding user roles and permissions to target services.
3. **Request Transformation**:
    - Modifies request payloads, headers, or query parameters as required by the downstream services.
4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
    - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user).
    - Throttles requests during peak loads to maintain service stability.
5. **Load Balancing**:
    - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a microservice for better scalability and fault tolerance.
6. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
    - Collects metrics on API usage, response times, and errors.
    - Logs requests and responses for debugging and analytics purposes.
7. **Error Handling**:
    - Returns standardized error messages to clients when a microservice fails or is unreachable.
8. **Caching**:
    - Implements caching for frequently accessed resources (e.g., public data or non-sensitive configurations) to reduce load on backend services.

### **API Gateway Technology Options**
1. **Tools**:
    - **Kong API Gateway**: Open-source, highly scalable, supports plugins for authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.
    - **AWS API Gateway**: Fully managed, integrates well with other AWS services.
    - **Traefik**: Open-source, dynamic routing with Kubernetes integration.
    - **NGINX**: A high-performance option with custom configurations for API routing and load balancing.
2. **Preferred Choice**:
    - Use **Kong API Gateway** for its extensibility and robust plugin ecosystem.
    - If working with Kubernetes, consider **Traefik** for seamless integration.
