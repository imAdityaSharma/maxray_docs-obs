### **X-ray Service: Design, Responsibilities, and Implementation**

The **X-ray Service** is a microservice dedicated to managing diagnostic imaging processes. It supports X-ray capture, metadata management, storage, and integration with consultations, ensuring doctors can access and review X-ray results efficiently.

---
### **Responsibilities**
1. **X-ray Image Management**:
    - Upload and store X-ray images securely.
    - Retrieve images for consultation reviews.
2. **Metadata Management**:
    - Store and manage metadata for each X-ray image (e.g., capture date, paramedic details, patient ID).
    - Link X-rays to consultations and patients.
3. **Integration with Other Services**:
    - Retrieve patient and consultation details from the **Patient Service**.
    - Share uploaded X-rays with the **Doctor Service** for diagnosis.
4. **Security and Compliance**:
    - Ensure images are encrypted during upload and at rest.
    - Log all actions for audit purposes (e.g., image access or deletion).
5. **Storage Optimization**:
    - Use object storage (e.g., S3-compatible storage) for cost-effective and scalable image storage.
---
### **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python (FastAPI or Flask for REST APIs).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata storage.
- **Object Storage**: AWS S3, MinIO, or Google Cloud Storage for image files.
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven notifications.

   |
   v
[API Gateway] --> [X-ray Service]
                     |
                     |---> [PostgreSQL (Metadata)]
                     |---> [Object Storage (S3/MinIO)]
                     |---> [Patient Service]
                     |---> [Doctor Service]
```
### **API Endpoints**

| **Method** | **Endpoint**           | **Description**                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| POST       | `/xrays`               | Upload an X-ray image and metadata.     |
| GET        | `/xrays/<id>`          | Retrieve metadata of a specific X-ray.  |
| GET        | `/xrays/<id>/download` | Download the X-ray image.               |
| DELETE     | `/xrays/<id>`          | Delete an X-ray image and its metadata. |
