### **Functional Requirements

1. **Account and Profile Management**:
    
    - **Login and Authentication**: Doctors must be able to securely log in to the platform via SSO with OAuth2.0.
    - **Profile Setup**: Doctors can set up and update their profiles, including their specialty, experience, and availability.
2. **Patient Management**:
    
    - **View Patient History**: Doctors can access patients’ past medical history, consultations, and any previous X-ray or test results available on the platform.
    - **Patient Notes**: Doctors can create and save notes about the patient’s condition during consultations, visible only to them and other authorized doctors.
3. **Teleconsultation and Communication**:
    
    - **Initiate Video/Audio Consultation**: Doctors can start secure video/audio consultations with patients through the platform’s teleconferencing service.
    - **Chat and Messaging**: Doctors can communicate with patients or paramedics via in-app messaging before, during, or after consultations.
    - **Multi-Party Teleconference**: Doctors can include paramedics or other specialists in a teleconsultation as needed.
4. **Prescription and Test Recommendation**:
    - **Prescription Creation**: Doctors can create prescriptions via audio-to-text or manually through the app.
    - **Recommend Tests**: Doctors can recommend specific tests, including X-rays, which can be noted directly in the patient’s file.
    - **Prescription Verification**: Doctors can verify or edit their prescriptions before finalizing to ensure accuracy.
5. **Emergency Handling**:
    - **Respond to Emergency Requests**: Doctors should be able to receive notifications about emergency cases requiring immediate attention.
    - **Assign Paramedic**: If necessary, doctors can request paramedic support and coordinate directly for on-site services.
6. **Medical Record Access**:
    - **View and Download X-rays/Images**: Doctors can view and download medical images like X-rays for closer examination.
    - **Upload Diagnostic Notes**: After reviewing an X-ray, doctors can add notes or diagnoses directly in the patient’s file.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Usability**:
    
    - **User-Friendly Interface**: The doctor interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing quick access to patient history, X-rays, and other critical information.
    - **Responsiveness**: All actions (e.g., starting a consultation, accessing patient data) should complete within 1 second to ensure efficient workflows.
    - **Accessibility**: The platform should be accessible on both mobile devices and desktops, ensuring doctors can use it regardless of their device preference.
2. **Performance**:
    
    - **Consultation Latency**: Video and audio streams should have a latency of <200 ms to maintain a natural flow in consultations.
    - **System Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime, especially for the teleconsultation and patient management services, to avoid disruptions.
    - **Data Loading Time**: Patient data, including X-ray images, should load in under 2 seconds, even with large files, to minimize waiting time for doctors.
3. **Security**:
    
    - **Data Privacy**: All patient data viewed by the doctor must be encrypted and accessible only with proper authorization.
    - **Session Timeout**: Implement session timeouts to automatically log doctors out after a period of inactivity to enhance data security.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for doctors logging in from new devices or locations for added security.
4. **Compliance**:
    - **HIPAA and DISHA Compliance**: All interactions, including consultations, prescriptions, and patient record access, should comply with HIPAA and DISHA standards.
    - **Audit Trail**: Maintain detailed logs of doctor activities (e.g., accessed patient records, prescriptions created) for traceability and compliance.
5. **Scalability**:
    - **Concurrent Consultations**: The system should support a high number of simultaneous consultations without affecting performance.
    - **Load Handling**: The platform should be able to scale automatically during high-demand periods, like peak consultation hours, without performance degradation.
6. **Reliability**:
    
    - **Teleconferencing Resilience**: The teleconferencing feature should have failover mechanisms to ensure continuity if the primary server experiences downtime.
    - **Error Handling**: Implement clear error messages and recovery options if there are issues loading patient data, video consultations, or prescriptions.
7. **Interoperability**:
    
    - **Device Compatibility**: The platform should work seamlessly across devices (mobile, desktop) and browsers, as well as different operating systems (iOS, Android).
    - **Integration with External Systems**: Allow integration with other healthcare systems or databases for patient data import/export, if applicable.
