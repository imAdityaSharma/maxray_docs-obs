### **Functional Requirements

1. **Account and Profile Management**:
    
    - **Login and Authentication**: Paramedics should securely log in via SSO using OAuth2.0.
    - **Profile Setup and Status**: Paramedics can update their profile, including their availability status and contact information.
2. **Emergency Response**:
    
    - **Receive Emergency Alerts**: Paramedics should receive real-time notifications for emergency requests from patients or doctors.
    - **Arrival Tracking**: Paramedics can share their live location with patients, allowing patients to track their estimated arrival in real-time.
    - **Onsite Assistance**: Paramedics can update the patient status or request additional support from nearby facilities if required.
3. **X-ray Device Management**:
    
    - **Operate X-ray Device**: Paramedics should be able to operate the X-ray device onsite, including setting exposure settings and positioning.
    - **Upload X-ray Images**: Paramedics can capture and upload X-ray images to the system directly from the device for doctor review.
    - **View Device Status**: Paramedics can monitor device status indicators, including battery life, charge, and connection status, ensuring it is ready for use.
4. **Communication and Coordination**:
    
    - **Teleconferencing with Doctors**: Paramedics should be able to join teleconsultations with doctors and patients for live communication during emergencies.
    - **In-App Messaging**: Paramedics can communicate with patients and doctors via in-app messaging for updates or additional instructions.
5. **Diagnostic Data Collection**:
    
    - **Capture and Record Patient Vitals**: Paramedics can input or capture vital signs (such as blood pressure, heart rate) and other diagnostic data if required, which is then added to the patient’s medical record.
    - **Access Medical History**: Paramedics can view the patient’s relevant medical history, ensuring they are informed of any pre-existing conditions or ongoing treatments.
6. **Incident Reporting**:
    
    - **Log Emergency Events**: Paramedics can log details of the onsite visit, including actions taken, complications, or recommendations for further medical support.
    - **Report Equipment Issues**: Paramedics should be able to report device issues or malfunctions directly through the app for maintenance.

### **Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**:
    
    - **Intuitive Interface**: The interface should be easy to navigate for quick access to emergency alerts, patient information, and device controls, even in stressful conditions.
    - **Hands-Free Operation**: Provide support for voice commands or simplified controls for paramedics who may need hands-free options when dealing with patients.
    - **Response Time**: All actions (e.g., viewing patient data, joining teleconsultations, operating the X-ray device) should respond within 1 second for efficient workflow.
2. **Performance**:
    
    - **Real-Time Communication**: Ensure minimal latency (<200 ms) in audio and video teleconsultation with doctors to maintain clear communication.
    - **X-ray Image Upload Speed**: X-ray images should upload to the system in under 2 minutes after capture for immediate doctor review.
    - **Location Accuracy**: The paramedic’s location should be updated in real-time with an accuracy of ±10 meters, especially for emergency response.
3. **Security**:
    
    - **Data Privacy**: Ensure all data collected or transmitted (patient information, X-ray images) is encrypted with TLS 1.3 and stored securely with AES-256 encryption.
    - **Access Control**: Paramedics should have restricted access only to the information necessary for their specific cases, ensuring compliance with data privacy laws.
    - **Session Timeout**: Implement session timeouts to log paramedics out after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access if the device is left unattended.
4. **Reliability**:
    
    - **Device Availability**: The X-ray device should be available and operational at least 99.9% of the time to ensure it can be used when required.
    - **Redundancy**: Implement failover mechanisms to prevent data loss or service disruption if the primary device or system experiences issues.
    - **Offline Capability**: Provide an offline mode allowing paramedics to capture images and patient data locally, which can be synced with the platform once the connection is restored.
5. **Scalability**:
    
    - **Support Multiple Concurrent Users**: The system should support a high number of paramedics simultaneously responding to emergencies or operating devices without performance degradation.
    - **Load Management**: Enable automatic scaling to handle increased usage during peak times, such as during major incidents or emergencies.
6. **Compliance**:
    - **HIPAA and DISHA Compliance**: All interactions, including consultations, prescriptions, and patient record access, should comply with HIPAA and DISHA standards.
    - **Audit Logging**: Maintain a log of all paramedic activities (e.g., patient data access, X-ray captures, updates) for at least one year to support audits and compliance reviews.
7. **Interoperability**:
    
    - **Device Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with various mobile devices used by paramedics (e.g., Android, iOS) and provide seamless connectivity with the X-ray device.
    - **Third-Party Integration**: Enable integration with local emergency services and healthcare facilities for cases that require additional or advanced medical support.
8. **Support and Assistance**:
    
    - **24/7 Technical Support**: Provide 24/7 access to technical support for paramedics encountering issues with the device, app, or teleconferencing.
    - **Guided Instructions for Device Use**: Offer in-app tutorials or step-by-step guidance for using the X-ray device, capturing patient data, and responding to emergencies effectively.
