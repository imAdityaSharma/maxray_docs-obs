### **1. Performance Requirements**

1. **System Uptime**: Ensure 99.9% uptime across all services to provide continuous availability for teleconsultations, X-ray uploads, and patient records.
2. **API Response Time**: All API endpoints should have an average response time of less than 200 ms to minimize latency.
3. **Teleconferencing Latency**: Maintain teleconferencing latency below 200 ms to ensure smooth video/audio interactions.
4. **Data Throughput**: The system should handle up to 1,000 simultaneous teleconsultations and process X-ray images and uploads without performance degradation.
5. **Real-Time Data Processing**: Enable real-time or near real-time data processing for teleconsultation logs, patient data access, and device status updates.

### **2. Redundancy and Backup Requirements**

1. **Node Redundancy**: Implement a minimum of two physical slave nodes and one physical master node in each swarm instance to provide failover support.
2. **Data Backup Frequency**: Perform automatic backups at hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly intervals to ensure data availability in case of a failure.
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Establish disaster recovery protocols with a recovery time objective (RTO) of under 2 hours and recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 30 minutes.
4. **Replication of Production Environment**: Maintain a replicated environment of the production setup for backup and load balancing.

### **3. Data Management Requirements**

1. **Data Storage**:
    - Use a **relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data like user accounts, medical records, and consultations.
    - Use **object storage** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for unstructured data such as X-ray images and video call recordings.
2. **Data Retention**: Patient records and teleconsultation logs must be stored securely for a minimum of 7 years, in compliance with local healthcare regulations.
3. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption and TLS 1.3 to secure sensitive patient and medical data.
4. **HIPAA and DISHA Compliance**: All interactions, including consultations, prescriptions, and patient record access, should comply with HIPAA and DISHA standards.

### **4. Monitoring and Logging Requirements**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring of critical system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network latency.
2. **Service Health Checks**: Set up automated health checks for each microservice and node to detect any downtime or performance degradation.
3. **Log Management**:
    - Enable centralized logging of all user activities, teleconsultations, X-ray operations, and data access.
    - Ensure logs are retained for a minimum of 1 year for audit purposes.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Configure alerts for system anomalies, such as high latency, low storage availability, or unauthorized access attempts.
5. **Telemetry Data Collection**: Collect telemetry data on device usage, system load, and patient engagement to analyze and improve system performance.

### **5. Scalability and Elasticity Requirements**

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Enable horizontal scaling for all microservices to handle increased demand during peak usage.
2. **Auto-Scaling Policies**: Set auto-scaling policies to add or remove instances based on real-time traffic and load.
3. **Load Balancer**: Deploy a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly across available servers to prevent bottlenecks.
4. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use a CDN for efficient data distribution of static assets like app images, patient records, and X-ray reports to improve load times for end-users.

### **6. Security and Access Control Requirements**

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implement SSO for user authentication, using OAuth2.0 to manage secure logins for patients, doctors, and paramedics.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define and enforce role-based access control for all users to limit access based on user roles (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Paramedic, Admin).
3. **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure all data exchanges between clients (apps, web) and servers are encrypted with TLS 1.3 to secure sensitive information.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable multi-factor authentication for administrators and high-privilege users to enhance access security.
5. **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed audit logs of all access and modification activities within the system to support traceability and security compliance.

### **7. Teleconferencing and Device Integration Requirements**

1. **Teleconferencing Server Redundancy**: Maintain a backup teleconferencing server to ensure uninterrupted video/audio consultation if the primary server fails.
2. **Device Connectivity**:
    - Enable automatic detection of X-ray devices within the local network.
    - Implement secure Wi-Fi connections for device communication, ensuring compliance with ISO26262 for device reliability.
3. **Diagnostic Tools**: Include device diagnostics to monitor and report real-time status (battery, exposure count) of X-ray generators to prevent failure during consultations.
4. **X-ray Data Sync**: Enable rapid syncing of X-ray images between the X-ray device and cloud storage, ensuring images are available to the doctor in under 2 minutes after capture.

### **8. Maintenance and Support Requirements**

1. **Automated Software Updates**: Implement an automated system for updating the software on all devices, including mobile apps and X-ray devices, with minimal downtime.
2. **Scheduled Maintenance Windows**: Define and communicate regular maintenance windows to ensure minimal disruption for users.
3. **User Support System**:
    - Provide a 24/7 support system to address technical issues reported by patients, doctors, and paramedics. ( LLM powered chatbot )
    - Include an issue tracking system to log, monitor, and resolve reported issues.
4. **Testing Environments**: Maintain separate testing and development environments that mirror the production setup to safely test new features and patches before deployment.
