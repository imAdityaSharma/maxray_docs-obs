### **Paramedic Service: Design, Responsibilities, and Implementation**

The **Paramedic Service** focuses on managing paramedic profiles, task assignments, emergency responses, and integration with X-ray operations. It ensures paramedics can efficiently handle tasks assigned to them during emergencies and provides tools for uploading diagnostic images.

---
### **Responsibilities**
1. **Paramedic Profile Management**:
    - Create, update, and retrieve paramedic profiles.
    - Manage paramedic availability and status (e.g., `Available`, `On-Task`).
2. **Emergency Task Management**:
    - Receive and manage emergency requests from patients.
    - Track task statuses (e.g., `Pending`, `In-Progress`, `Completed`).
3. **X-ray Device Operations**:
    - Enable paramedics to capture and upload X-ray images during on-site visits.
    - Associate X-ray images with corresponding consultations.
4. **Integration with Other Services**:
    - Communicate with the Patient Service for emergency details.
    - Update the Notification Service for task assignments and reminders.
    - Store X-ray metadata in the X-ray Service for later doctor review.
---
### **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python (FastAPI or Flask for REST APIs).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data (paramedic profiles, emergency tasks).
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage for uploading and managing X-ray images.
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication with Notification and Patient services.
