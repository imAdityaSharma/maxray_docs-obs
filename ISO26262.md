1. **software level** ✅ TBD now
2. **hardware level -** later phase
3. **system level** ✅ TBD now
### **ISO 26262 Requirements**
1. **Safety Lifecycle Compliance**:
    - Include safety analysis and Risk Assessment 
    - Define safety goals and map them
    - Design systems for fault tolerance and fail-safe mechanisms.
2. **Traceability**:
    - Ensure traceability from safety requirements to system implementation and validation.
3. **Risk Mitigation**:
    - Implement redundancy for critical components.
4. **Validation and Verification**:
    - Rigorous testing to ensure safety goals are met.
5. **Functional and Software Development Standards**:

### **Personal Data Protection (Relevant Sections)**

If the project involves processing personal data under the **Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018**, the following are critical:

1. **Data Minimization**:
    - Collect only the data necessary for safety and operational goals.
2. **Purpose Limitation**:
    - Use collected data solely for specified safety or system requirements.
3. **Transparency and Notification**:
    - Inform users (data principals) about data collection, use, and storage.
4. **Sensitive Data Protection**:
    - Encrypt sensitive personal data such as biometric or location data (if collected).
    - Limit sharing of sensitive data to safety-critical applications.
5. **Data Retention and Deletion**:
    - Store personal data only as long as needed for system safety operations and compliance.
6. **Data Breach Protocols**:
    - Implement safeguards and notify relevant authorities promptly in case of breaches.

### **Key Steps for Alignment**
1. **Integrate Standards**:
    - Combine ISO 26262 safety lifecycle with ASPICE process maturity requirements to ensure high quality and traceability.
    - Incorporate Personal Data Protection protocols into the system for legal compliance.
2. **Documentation and Accountability**:
    - Maintain records of data processing activities, safety validations, and risk assessments.
3. **System Design**:
    - Implement Privacy by Design principles to integrate safety and data protection measures from the start.
